I need us to rebuild the database and model learning to use the data in historical_matches_2026-02-01.json for training instead of results.txt. That means that the way teh database is tructured has to change, for example, rather than use 5 code for identifying the league, we will use the json file to identify and save leagues. sample data from one url in the json file:  {
    "url": "/en/football/matches/cobresal-huachipato-2419652",
    "home_team": "Cobresal",
    "away_team": "Huachipato",
    "datetime": "2026-01-31",
    "date": "2026-01-31",
    "time": "00:00",
    "league_code": "Cl1",
    "match_id": "2419652",
    "country": "Chile",
    "league": "Primera Division",
    "league_url_path": "football-tips-and-predictions-for-chile/primera-division",
    "country_code": "cl",
    "prob_home": 48.0,
    "prob_draw": 24.0,
    "prob_away": 27.0,
    "prediction": "home",
    "home_score": 1,
    "away_score": 0,
    "actual_result": "home",
    "has_result": true,
    "predicted_avg_goals": 2.8,
    "odds": 2.15
  },. therefore, each league will be identified by "league_code": "Cl1",
    "match_id": "2419652",
    "country": "Chile",
    "league": "Primera Division",
    "league_url_path": "football-tips-and-predictions-for-chile/primera-division",
    "country_code": "cl",

also recheck scrape_historical.py which is the source file for historical_matches_2026-02-01 to ensure game urls are scarpped correctly. for example, if the url name is wrong, e.g  "url": "/en/football/matches/diriang\u00e9n-fc-unan-managua-2420380",
    "home_team": "Diriang\u00e9n FC",
    "away_team": "UNAN Managua",
    "datetime": "2026-01-31",
    "date": "2026-01-31",
    "time": "00:00", the resulting team names will be incorect Diriang\u00e9n FC instead of Diriangen FC. 
    Consequently, model training will be based on the same json file since it has the results. in a nut shell given the complete information from each url in this historical_matches_2026-02-01, decide how best we can structure the database so that league information and other important detaiols are captured correctly.




    since we are rebuilding the historical db afresh, clear all the old data so that new learning should start a fresh from 2026-01-25  to /2026-02-11
